### Progress in Coding
This repository is created to document my progress in coding.
Here, I will update my progress regularly to keep track of my improvement.

Progress
March 2023: I started learning Python programming language and completed several beginner-level projects. I learned basic syntax and concepts such as variables, loops,               conditionals, and functions.

April 2023: I continued practicing Python and began learning web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I completed a few small web projects and learned how to use Git for version control.

May 2023: I started learning databases and SQL. I also began working on a group project with my classmates, where we are building a web application using Flask framework.

Future Plans
My future plans include continuing to practice and improve my skills in Python programming, web development, and databases. I plan to learn more advanced concepts in these areas and work on more challenging projects. I also want to learn new programming languages and frameworks such as React and Django. In addition, I plan to participate in coding competitions and contribute to open-source projects to gain more experience.

Feel free to leave comments or suggestions on how I can improve my progress in coding.
