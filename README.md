Wow, One Hundred Days?!
Yeah, that's a lot! It's a big commitment, but you'll do great!

Python is a great language for beginners :<br/>

⚡*It's easy to learn<br/>
⚡️Has an active supportive community<br/>
⚡️Offers versatile opportunities in web development, games, data science<br/>
⚡️Replit is the best place to learn to code because there's zero set up - 
   which means you do not have to download, set up, or install anything. You already did all the work needed because you are here!<br/>

All you need to do now is follow along with the video, go from one chapter to the next in this tutorial panel, and just have fun! Now let's go!<br/>

## Progress in Coding<br/> ##
This repository is created to document my progress in coding.
Here, I will update my progress regularly to keep track of my improvement.

## Progres<br/><br/>
1 Days_1 ==>> 16 March 2023: I started learning Python programming language and completed several beginner-level projects.<br/>
I learned basic syntax and concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.<br/>

2 Days_1 ==>> 16 April 2023: I continued practicing Python and began learning web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br/>
I completed a few small web projects and learned how to use Git for version control.<br/>

where we are building a web application using Flask framework.<br/>

## Future Plans<br/><br/>
My future plans include continuing to practice and improve my skills in Python programming, web development, and databases. <br/>
I plan to learn more advanced concepts in these areas and work on more challenging projects. <br/>
I also want to learn new programming languages and frameworks such as React and Django.<br/>
In addition, I plan to participate in coding competitions and contribute to open-source projects to gain more experience.<br/><br/>

Feel free to leave comments or suggestions on how I can improve my progress in coding.
