# Day 1 - 100-Days #

Wow, One Hundred Days?!<br/>
Yeah, that's a lot! It's a big commitment, but you'll do great!

Python is a great language for beginners :<br/>

   ⚡️ It's easy to learn<br/>
   ⚡️ Has an active supportive community<br/>
   ⚡️ Offers versatile opportunities in web development, games, data science<br/>
   ⚡️ Replit is the best place to learn to code because there's zero set up - which means you do not have to download, set up, or install anything<br/>

You already did all the work needed because you are here!
All you need to do now is follow along with the video, go from one chapter to the next in this tutorial panel, and just have fun! Now let's go!<br/>

## Future Plans <br/><br/>
My future plans include continuing to practice and improve my skills in Python programming, web development, and databases. <br/>
I plan to learn more advanced concepts in these areas and work on more challenging projects. <br/>
I also want to learn new programming languages and frameworks such as React and Django.<br/>
In addition, I plan to participate in coding competitions and contribute to open-source projects to gain more experience.<br/><br/>

Feel free to leave comments or suggestions on how I can improve my progress in coding.
